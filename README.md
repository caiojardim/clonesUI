# clonesUI
 This project has the objective to impruve my html and css habilities by cloning the interface off some layouts from Figma or real aplications
 
 <h2>Gravity</h2>
 
 layout: https://www.figma.com/file/1c23Mcr1Ej2yhUT0nq3i1X/Time-Tracking-Landing-Page-Hero-(Community)
 
 At this point i need top create the responsive to pass by mobal to desktop.
 
 <h3>Cloning this interface I learned:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Use external fonts with @font-face</li>
  <li>Edit svg img</li>
  <li>Use box-shadow</li>
  <li>Resize image by view whidth</li>
  <li>Reuse proprieties of @media without repeating</li>
 </ul>
  
 <h3>things I need to improve</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Coding this interface I found it difficult to make the responsive part especially on how I can change the size of the elements to fit the screen</li>
 </ul>
